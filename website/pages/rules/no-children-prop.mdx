# no-children-prop

## Rule category

Restriction.

## What it does

Disallows passing of children as props.

## Why is this bad?

Most of the time, `children` should be actual `children`, not passed in as a `prop`.

When using JSX, the `children` should be nested between the opening and closing tags. When not using JSX, the `children` should be passed as additional arguments to `React.createElement`.

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function Example({ children }: ExampleProps) {
  return <div children={children} />;
  //          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  //          Children should always be actual children, not passed in as a prop.
}
```

### Passing

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function Example({ children }: ExampleProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      // @annotate: Pass 'children' as actual children
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
