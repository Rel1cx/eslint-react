# no-script-url

## Rule category

Security.

## What it does

Prevents usage of `javascript:` URLs as the value of certain attributes.

## Why is this bad?

`javascript:` URLs are a form of [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack. They allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of your website, which can be used to steal user data, deface your website, or perform other malicious actions.

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";

function Example() {
  return <a href="javascript:alert('Hello, world!')">Click me</a>;
  //             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //             Using a `javascript:` URL is a security risk and should be avoided.
}
```

### Passing

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";

function Example() {
  return <a href="/some-page">Click me</a>;
}
```
