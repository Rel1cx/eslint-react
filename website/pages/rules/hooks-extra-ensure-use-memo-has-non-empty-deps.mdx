# ensure-use-memo-has-non-empty-deps

## Rule category

Pedantic.

## What it does

Warns when `useMemo` is called with empty dependencies array.

## Why is this bad?

React Hooks `useMemo` has empty dependencies array like what's in the examples, are unnecessary. The hook can be removed and it's value can be calculated in the component body or hoisted to the outer scope of the component.

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import { Button, MantineTheme } from "@mantine/core";

function Example() {
  const style = useMemo(
    (theme: MantineTheme) => ({
      input: {
        fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyMonospace,
      },
    }),
    []
  );
  return <Button sx={style} />;
}
```

### Passing

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Button, MantineTheme } from "@mantine/core";

const style = (theme: MantineTheme) => ({
  input: {
    fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyMonospace,
  },
});

function Example() {
  return <Button sx={style} />;
}
```
