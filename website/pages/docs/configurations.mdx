# Configurations

ESLint React provides the following configurations:

## Settings

### `version`

```ts
const version = "detect" satisfies string
```

React version to perform the analysis, `"detect"` means auto detect React version from the project's dependencies.

If failed to detect, it will use the `19.0.0` version.

### `importSource`

```ts
const importSource = "react" satisfies string
```

<Callout type="info">If `importSource` is specified, an equivalent version of React should be provided to the [`version`](#version) setting.</Callout>

The source where React is imported from.

This allows to specify a custom import location for React when not using the official distribution.

For example, if you are using `@pika/react` instead of `react`, you can set the `importSource` to `@pika/react`:

```tsx
import React from "@pika/react";
```

### `polymorphicPropName`

```ts
const polymorphicPropName = "as" satisfies string
```

You can optionally use the `polymorphicPropName` setting to define the prop your code uses to create polymorphic components. This setting will be used determine the element type in rules that require semantic context.

For example, if you set the `polymorphicPropName` setting to `as` then this element:

```tsx
<Box as="h3">Configurations</Box>
```

will be evaluated as an `h3`.

If no `polymorphicPropName` is set, then the component will be evaluated as `Box`.

### `additionalComponents`

```ts
interface ComponentAttributeEntry {
  name: string;
  as?: string;
  defaultValue?: string;
}

interface ComponentEntry {
  name: string;
  as?: string;
  attributes: ComponentAttributeEntry[];
}

const additionalComponents = [] satisfies ComponentEntry[]
```

<Callout type="info">Before using `additionalComponents`, consider whether `polymorphicPropName` can be used instead, as it simpler and more efficient.</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">This is an experimental feature that can be unstable and lacks documentation.</Callout>

An array of components and its attributes mapping. It allows the related rules to do even more comprehensive analysis. You can also provide default values for attributes here, that will be used when that attribute is not present in the component.

For example, if you set the `additionalComponents` to:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "EmbedContent",
    "as": "iframe",
    "attributes": [
      { "name": "sandbox", "defaultValue": "" }
    ]
  }
]
```

then this element:

```tsx
<EmbedContent src="https://eslint-react.xyz" />
```

will be evaluated as an:

```tsx
<iframe src="https://eslint-react.xyz" sandbox="" />
```

So that both the `dom/no-missing-iframe-sandbox` and `dom/no-unsafe-iframe-sandbox` rules can perform checks on it.

### `additionalHooks`

```ts
const additionalHooks = { useLayoutEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"] } satisfies Record<ReactBuiltInHookName, string[]>
```

<Callout type="warning">This is intended to cover edge cases. We suggest using the built-in React Hooks whenever possible.</Callout>

A object of aliases for React built-in Hooks. ESLint React will recognize these aliases as equivalent to the built-in Hooks in all its rules.

For example, if you set the `additionalHooks` to:

```json
{ useLayoutEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"] }
```

then the React Hook call:

```tsx
useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => { setCount(count => count + 1); }, []);
```

will be evaluated as an:

```tsx
useLayoutEffect(() => { setCount(count => count + 1); }, []);
```

So that the `hooks-extra/no-direct-set-state-in-use-layout-effect` rule can perform checks on it.

## Examples

```ts filename="eslint.config.js"
import eslintReact from "@eslint-react/eslint-plugin";

export default [
  // ...
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    ...eslintReact.configs.recommended,
    settings: {
      "react-x": {
        version: "19.0.0",
        additionalHooks: {
          useLayoutEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"],
        },
        additionalComponents: [
          {
            name: "Link",
            as: "a",
            attributes: [
              { name: "to", as: "href" },
            ],
          },
          {
            name: "EmbedContent",
            as: "iframe",
            attributes: [
              { name: "sandbox", defaultValue: "" }
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
];
```
