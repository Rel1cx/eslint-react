# ensure-custom-hooks-using-other-hooks

## Rule category

Correctness.

## What it does

Warns when custom Hooks that don't use other Hooks.

## Why is this good?

Custom Hooks may call other Hooks (that’s their whole purpose). If a custom Hook is not calling other Hooks, it might be a sign that it's unnecessary or incorrectly implemented. This rule helps you catch those cases.

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react';

// @warn: Custom Hooks should use other Hooks.
function useClassnames(obj: Record<string, boolean>) {
  var k, cls = "";
  for (k in obj) {
    if (obj[k]) {
      cls && (cls += " ");
      cls += k;
    }
  }
  return cls;
};
```

### Passing

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react';

function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
  return { count, increment };
}
```
