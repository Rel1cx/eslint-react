# no-unstable-context-value

## What it does

Prevents non-stable values (i.e. object literals) from being used as a value for `Context.Provider`.

## Why is this bad?

React will re-render all consumers of a context whenever the context value changes, and if the value is not stable, this can lead to unnecessary re-renders.

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
import React from "react";

const ExampleContext = React.createContext({});

function ExampleProvider() {
  return (
    <ExampleContext.Provider value={{ foo: "bar" }}>
    {/*                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ */}
    {/*                             - A/an 'Object literal' passed as the value prop to the context provider should not be constructed. It will change on every render. Consider wrapping it in a useMemo hook */}
      <ExampleConsumer />
    </ExampleContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### Passing

```tsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";

const ExampleContext = React.createContext({});

const value = { foo: "bar" };

function ExampleProvider() {
  return (
    <ExampleContext.Provider value={value}>
      <ExampleConsumer />
    </ExampleContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

## Legitimate Uses

React Context, and all its child nodes and Consumers are rerendered whenever the value prop changes. Because each Javascript object carries its own identity, things like object expressions (`{foo: 'bar'}`) or function expressions get a new identity on every run through the component. This makes the context think it has gotten a new object and can cause needless rerenders and unintended consequences.

This can be a pretty large performance hit because not only will it cause the context providers and consumers to rerender with all the elements in its subtree, the processing for the tree scan react does to render the provider and find consumers is also wasted.
