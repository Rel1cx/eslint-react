# no-children-count

## What it does

Prevents the use of `Children.count` from the `react` package.

## Why is this bad?

Using `Children` is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. [See common alternatives](https://react.dev/reference/react/Children#alternatives).

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
import React, { Children } from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function Example({ children }: ExampleProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Total rows: {Children.count(children)}</h1>
      ...
    </>
  );
}
```
