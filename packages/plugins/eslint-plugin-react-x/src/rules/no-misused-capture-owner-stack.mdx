## Description

Prevents incorrect usage of `captureOwnerStack`.

The `captureOwnerStack` is only available in development builds of React and must be:

1. Imported via namespace to avoid direct named imports.
2. Conditionally accessed within an `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {...}` block to prevent execution in production environments.
3. The call of `captureOwnerStack` happened inside of a React controlled function (**not implemented yet**).

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
// Failing: Using named import directly
import { captureOwnerStack } from "react";
//       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//       - Don't use named imports of `captureOwnerStack` in files that are bundled for development and production. Use a namespace import instead.

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();
  console.log("Owner Stack", ownerStack);
}
```

```tsx
// Failing: Missing environment check
import * as React from "react";

const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();
//                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                 - `captureOwnerStack` should only be used in development builds. Use an environment check to ensure it is not executed in production.
console.log(ownerStack);
```

### Passing

```tsx
// Passing: Correct namespace import with environment check
import * as React from "react";

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();
  console.log("Owner Stack", ownerStack);
}
```
