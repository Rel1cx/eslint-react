# `rules-of-hooks`

Enforces the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks).

## Ported _verbatim_ from `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`

**THIS RULE IS PORTED FROM** [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/rules/RulesOfHooks.ts).

**DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY.**

Changes to the rule logic should be made upstream in the React repository and then re-ported to this project.

### Local Adaptations

The following local adaptations have been made to integrate with `eslint-plugin-react-x`:

- `getAdditionalEffectHooksFromSettings` has been replaced by `getSettingsFromContext` from `@eslint-react/shared`, reading `additionalEffectHooks` from the `react-x` settings namespace.

### Additional Files

This rule also includes a ported version of the **Code Path Analyzer** from ESLint (`lib.ts`), which is used for control flow analysis. The Code Path Analyzer is licensed under the MIT License (Copyright OpenJS Foundation and other contributors).
