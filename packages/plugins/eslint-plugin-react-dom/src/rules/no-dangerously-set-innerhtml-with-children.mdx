**Full Name in `eslint-plugin-react-dom`**

```sh copy
react-dom/no-dangerously-set-innerhtml-with-children
```

**Full Name in `@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`**

```sh copy
@eslint-react/dom/no-dangerously-set-innerhtml-with-children
```

**Presets**

- `dom`
- `recommended`
- `recommended-typescript`
- `recommended-type-checked`

## Description

Disallow `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and `children` at the same time.

When using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, the content of the DOM element is set from the `__html` property. The content of the DOM element is completely replaced, so the children will not be rendered as expected.

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
import React from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "Hello World" }}>
      <p>Goodbye World</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Passing

```tsx
import React from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "Hello World" }} />;
}
```
