### Language Config

The configuration file used to control the Language Features and Language Servers.

Language Features and Language Servers are typically used by IDEs and editors to provide language features such as hover information, auto completion, jump to definition, error checking, formatting, refactoring, and more.

ESLint React uses the Language Config to provide information (e.g. [JSX Transform](/docs/configuration/configure-language-config#jsx-transform)) about the code it is linting.

For TypeScript or JavaScript files, the Language Config are typically named `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` and are located in the root of a project.

For MDX files, the Language Config is the `"mdx"` property in the `tsconfig.json` file.

### Language Preference

Language Preference is a set of rules that represents the user's preference for how code should be formatted.

ESLint React provides a way to customize the code style used in the internal fixer's output through Language Preference.
