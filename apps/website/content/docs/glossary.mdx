### Project Config

The configuration file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

For TypeScript or JavaScript files, the Project Config are typically named `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` and are located in the root of a project.

For MDX files, the Project Config is the `"mdx"` property in the `tsconfig.json` file.

ESLint React uses the Project Config to provide information (e.g., [JSX Transform](/docs/configuration/configure-project-config#jsx-transform)) about the code it is linting.
