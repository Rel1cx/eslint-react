  This guide provides a comprehensive comparison between [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) and ESLint React rules to help you migrate your existing configuration.
</Callout>

## Overview

ESLint React provides direct equivalents for the core rules in `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, including both the classic hooks linting rules (`exhaustive-deps`, `rules-of-hooks`) and many of the newer React Compiler diagnostic rules introduced in the latest versions of the plugin.

Rules specific to the React Compiler runtime (such as `config`, `gating`, `globals`, `incompatible-library`, and `preserve-manual-memoization`) do not have equivalents in ESLint React, as they validate compiler-specific configuration and behavior.

## Rule Comparison Table

### Legend

- 🔧 **Fully supported** - Rule is supported, and has an auto-fix
- ✅ **Mostly supported** - Rule is supported but doesn't have an auto-fix
- 🟡 **Partial support** - Similar but not identical functionality
- 🧪 **Experimental** - Rule is supported but marked as experimental
- ❌ **Not supported** - No equivalent rule

### Table

The following table compares all rules from `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` with their ESLint React equivalents:

### ESLint React Column

- Rule names link to ESLint React documentation
- Multiple rules separated by `+` indicate that together they provide equivalent functionality
- Rules marked 🧪 are experimental and their behavior may change in future releases
- Rules marked ❌ are React Compiler-specific and have no equivalent in ESLint React

## Migration Preset

ESLint React provides a preset to disable conflicting rules from `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`:

- `disable-conflict-eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - Disables all rules from `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` that have equivalents in ESLint React (e.g., `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`, etc.)

This preset is useful when migrating from `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` to ESLint React, as it prevents rule conflicts while you transition your configuration.
