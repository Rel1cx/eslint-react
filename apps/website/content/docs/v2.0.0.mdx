</Callout>

## **Embracing Modern JavaScript Standards**

To align with the direction of the JavaScript ecosystem, v2.0.0 introduces the following significant changes:

1. **ESM-Only**: `eslint-react.xyz` is now distributed exclusively as ECMAScript Modules (ESM).
2. **Flat Config Exclusive**: We have dropped support for the legacy `.eslintrc` format and now exclusively support ESLint's Flat Config for more powerful and flexible configurations.
3. **Updated Environment Requirements**:
   - **Node.js**: `18.x` ↦ `20.x`
   - **ESLint**: `8.x` ↦ `9.x`
   - **TypeScript**: `4.x` ↦ `5.x`

## **Rule Refactoring: More Consistent and Intuitive**

We have refactored our rules to make them easier to understand and use.

- **Rule Renaming**: Some rules have been renamed. For example, `ensure-forward-ref-using-ref` is now the more concise `no-useless-forward-ref`.

- **Rule Consolidation**: Scenarios that previously required configuring opposing rules are now handled by a single rule, simplifying your setup.

  ```javascript
  // Old way: Two opposing rules
  // "react-hooks-extra/no-direct-set-state-in-use-effect": "warn",
  // "react-hooks-extra/no-direct-set-state-in-use-layout-effect": "warn",

  // New way: Single consolidated rule handling all useEffect variants
  "react-x/no-direct-set-state-in-use-effect": "warn",
  ```

- **Rule Migration**: Several generic Hooks rules from the `react-hooks-extra` package have been moved to the core `react-x` plugin, such as `no-unnecessary-use-prefix`.

## **Introducing Powerful New Rules**

This release adds several new rules to help you write cleaner and more robust React code.

- **`react-x/no-unused-props`**: TSC-backed rule that flags component props that are defined but never used (credits to [@ulrichstark](https://github.com/ulrichstark) for the implementation).
- **`react-x/no-unnecessary-key`**: Flags unnecessary `key` props on elements that are not an iterator when rendering lists (credits to [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev) for the idea).
- **`react-dom/no-string-style-prop`**: Disallows using string values for the `style` prop, useful in non-TypeScript environments like MDX files (proposed by [@karlhorky](https://github.com/karlhorky)).
- **`react-dom/prefer-namespace-import`**: Enforces using a namespace import for `react-dom` (The React DOM version of `react-x/prefer-namespace-import`).

## **Developer Experience (DX) Improvements**

We believe a great tool should not only find problems but also help you fix them.

- **Enhanced Codemods & Auto-Fixes**: More rules, like `no-forward-ref`, now include codemods to automatically migrate legacy APIs to the new syntax in React 19 and support auto-fixing.

  For example, migrating `forwardRef`:

  ```tsx
  const MotionButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, HTMLMotionProps<"button">>(({ children, ...rest }, ref) => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

  can be automatically transformed to:

  ```tsx
  const MotionButton = ({ ref, children, ...rest }: HTMLMotionProps<"button"> & { ref?: React.RefObject<HTMLButtonElement | null> }) => {
    // ...
  };
  ```

  Other rules with React 19 codemods include `no-context-provider` and `no-use-context`.

  - `react-x/no-context-provider`: Replaces usages of `useContext(Context)` with `use(Context)`.
  - `react-x/no-use-context`: Replaces usages of `<Context.Provider>` with `<Context>`.

- **New `disable-conflict-eslint-plugin-react` Preset**: If you also use `eslint-plugin-react`, this new preset automatically disables rules that overlap with our plugin, enabling seamless integration.

## **Migration Guide**

To upgrade to v2.0.0, follow these steps:

1. **Update Node.js**: Ensure your environment is running Node.js 20.x or higher.
2. **Update Dependencies**: Update your `eslint-react.xyz` and related dependencies to the required versions.
3. **Review Rule Changes**: Check the [Changelog](/docs/changelog#v200-2025-09-26) for a complete list of rule changes and updates.
4. **Adjust ESLint Configurations**: Update your ESLint configuration to accommodate renamed or consolidated rules (convert to Flat Config if you haven't already).
5. **Update ESLint Directives**: Use the provided codemods to update any ESLint directives in your codebase.
6. **Test Your Setup**: Run ESLint on your codebase to identify and fix any issues.
