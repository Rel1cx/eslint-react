import { SettingsTypeTable } from "./configurations";

A [configuration object](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-objects) is used to configure the behavior of the rules in ESLint React. You can define the settings object in the `settings["react-x"]` field of your ESLint configuration file.

```ts title="eslint.config.js"
export default [
  {
    files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
    settings: {
      "react-x": {
        version: "19.0.0",
      },
    },
  },
];
```

## Properties

<SettingsTypeTable />

## Descriptions

### `version`

React version to perform the analysis, `"detect"` means auto detect React version from the project's dependencies.

If failed to detect, it will use the `19.0.0` version.

### `importSource`

<Callout type="info">If `importSource` is specified, an equivalent version of React should be provided to the [`version`](#version) setting.</Callout>

The source where React is imported from.

This allows to specify a custom import location for React when not using the official distribution.

For example, if you are using `@pika/react` instead of `react`, you can set the `importSource` to `@pika/react`:

```ts
import React from "@pika/react";
```

### `skipImportCheck`

When determining whether an API originates from React, bypass the import source check.

By default, the rule checks only the shape of the API to determine if it is a React API. If `skipImportCheck` is set to `false`, the rule will check both the shape and the import source.

For example, when `skipImportCheck` is set to false, the `memo` function from `unrelated-library` will not be recognized as React's `memo`.

```ts
import { memo } from "unrelated-library";

const NonComponentFunction = memo(() => {
  //                         ^^^^
  //                         - This will not be recognized as React's memo
});
```

### `polymorphicPropName`

You can optionally use the `polymorphicPropName` setting to define the prop your code uses to create polymorphic components. This setting will be used determine the element type in rules that require semantic context.

For example, if you set the `polymorphicPropName` setting to `as` then this element:

```tsx
<Box as="h3">Configurations</Box>
```

will be evaluated as an `h3`.

If no `polymorphicPropName` is set, then the component will be evaluated as `Box`.

### `additionalComponents`

<Callout type="info">Before using `additionalComponents`, consider whether `polymorphicPropName` can be used instead, as it simpler and more efficient.</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">This is an experimental feature that can be unstable and lacks documentation.</Callout>

An array of components and its attributes mapping. It allows the related rules to do even more comprehensive analysis. You can also provide default values for attributes here, that will be used when that attribute is not present.

For example, if you set the `additionalComponents` to:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "EmbedContent",
    "as": "iframe",
    "attributes": [
      {
        "name": "sandbox",
        "defaultValue": ""
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

then this element:

```tsx
<EmbedContent src="https://eslint-react.xyz" />
```

will be evaluated as an:

```tsx
<iframe src="https://eslint-react.xyz" sandbox="" />
```

So that both the `dom/no-missing-iframe-sandbox` and `dom/no-unsafe-iframe-sandbox` rules can perform checks on it.

### `additionalHooks`

<Callout type="warn">This is intended to cover edge cases. We suggest using the built-in React Hooks whenever possible.</Callout>

A object of aliases for React built-in Hooks. ESLint React will recognize these aliases as equivalent to the built-in Hooks in all its rules.

For example, if you set the `additionalHooks` to:

```json
{
  useEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"]
  useLayoutEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"]
}
```

then the React Hook call:

```ts
useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => { setCount(count => count + 1); }, []);
```

will be evaluated as:

```ts
useEffect(() => { setCount(count => count + 1); }, []);
```

and:

```ts
useLayoutEffect(() => { setCount(count => count + 1); }, []);
```

So that both the `hooks-extra/no-direct-set-state-in-use-effect` and `hooks-extra/no-direct-set-state-in-use-layout-effect` rules can perform checks on it.

## Examples

```ts title="eslint.config.js"
import eslintReact from "@eslint-react/eslint-plugin";

export default [
  // ...
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    ...eslintReact.configs.recommended,
    settings: {
      "react-x": {
        version: "19.0.0",
        importSource: "react",
        polymorphicPropName: "as",
        additionalHooks: {
          useEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"],
          useLayoutEffect: ["useIsomorphicLayoutEffect"],
        },
        additionalComponents: [
          {
            name: "Link",
            as: "a",
            attributes: [
              { name: "to", as: "href" },
            ],
          },
          {
            name: "EmbedContent",
            as: "iframe",
            attributes: [
              { name: "sandbox", defaultValue: "" }
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
];
```
