- [ ] `react-x/set-state-in-render` - Validates against setting state during render, which can trigger additional renders and potential infinite render loops (TBD)\
      _A fast implementation of [set-state-in-render](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/set-state-in-render) that doesn't require React Compiler integration_
- [ ] `react-x/function-component-definition` - Enforces the definition of function components ([Rel1cx/eslint-react#739](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/issues/739))
