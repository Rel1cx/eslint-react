<Accordion title="Why?">

**ESLint React addresses critical gaps of the existing `eslint-plugin-react` in modern React ecosystems**. While named "react", the current plugin implementation specifically targets React DOM and maintains DOM-centric assumptions, creating friction when used with alternative renderers like React Native, React Three Fiber, or custom reconcilers.

Our solution treating DOM as one of many supported targets rather than the default assumption. This paradigm shift enables:

- **Context-aware linting**: Adapting to different runtime environments
- **Future-proof architecture**: Compatibility with emerging React platforms
- **Unified code quality standards**: Seamless code specification experiences across platforms

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's included?">

Currently, it includes the following:

**Internal Packages**

- **Utility Modules**
  - `@eslint-react/eff`: JavaScript and TypeScript utilities (previously some re-exports of the `effect` library).
  - `@eslint-react/ast`: TSESTree AST utility module.
  - `@eslint-react/var`: TSESTree AST utility module for static analysis of variables.
  - `@eslint-react/jsx`: TSESTree AST utility module for static analysis of JSX.
  - `@eslint-react/kit`: ESLint React's plugin kit for building plugins and rules.
- **Core & Shared Modules**
  - `@eslint-react/core`: Utility module for static analysis of React core APIs and patterns.
  - `@eslint-react/shared`: Shared constants, types and functions.

<Accordion title='Why is there no "jsx-runtime" preset?'>

ESLint React reads your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` configuration files to determines how to perform the JSX analysis internally. This means that you don't need to configure the JSX runtime in ESLint React, as it will automatically use the one configured in your project.

Additionally, this approach avoids potential problems where the JSX runtime configured in `eslint.config.js` might conflict with the one configured in `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`.

For more information, see the [JSX Runtime](/docs/configuration/configure-language-config#jsx-runtime) section on the [Configure Language Config](/docs/configuration/configure-language-config) page.

<Accordion title="Is there anything to note about migrating from eslint-plugin-react?">

Please be aware that some rules may behave differently when transitioning to ESLint React. The rules in ESLint React are more closely aligned with the guidelines provided by [react.dev](https://react.dev). This alignment is due to ESLint React adopting [react.dev](https://react.dev) as its primary reference, rather than `eslint-plugin-react`.

To smoothly transition, we suggest reviewing the rules in ESLint React and running a comprehensive linting check on your codebase to identify and address any discrepancies introduced by the migration.
