<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why?">
    **ESLint React addresses critical gaps of the existing `eslint-plugin-react` in modern React ecosystems**. While named "react", the current plugin implementation specifically targets React DOM and maintains DOM-centric assumptions, creating friction when used with alternative renderers like React Native, React Three Fiber, or custom renderers.

    Our solution treating DOM as one of many supported targets rather than the default assumption. This paradigm shift enables:

    - **Context-aware linting**: Adapting to different runtime environments
    - **Future-proof architecture**: Compatibility with emerging React platforms
    - **Unified code quality standards**: Consistent linting across diverse projects
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's included?">
    Currently, it includes the following:

    **Internal Packages**

    - **Utility Modules**
      - `@eslint-react/eff`: JavaScript and TypeScript utilities (previously some re-exports of the `effect` library).
      - `@eslint-react/ast`: TSESTree AST utility module.
      - `@eslint-react/var`: TSESTree AST utility module for static analysis of variables.
    - **Core & Shared Modules**
      - `@eslint-react/core`: Utility module for static analysis of React core APIs and patterns.
      - `@eslint-react/shared`: Shared constants, types and functions.

    **Public Packages**

    - **ESLint Plugins**
      - [`eslint-plugin-react-x`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) - Core React rules.
      - [`eslint-plugin-react-dom`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) - React DOM rules.
      - [`eslint-plugin-react-web-api`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-web-api) - Web API interaction rules.
      - [`eslint-plugin-react-naming-convention`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-naming-convention) - Naming convention rules.
      - [`eslint-plugin-react-debug`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-debug) - Debugging rules for inspecting React patterns in code.
      - [`@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin) - A unified plugin that combines all individual plugins into one.

  <Accordion title="Why isn't there a 'jsx-runtime' preset?">
    ESLint React automatically detects your JSX runtime type from the compiler options in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file, as well as from JSX pragma comments (e.g., `/** @jsxRuntime automatic */`) in each file. This means you don't need to set a preset for the JSX runtime.

    For more information, see the [JSX Transform](/docs/configuration/configure-project-config#jsx-transform) section on the [Configure Project Config](/docs/configuration/configure-project-config) page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which one should I use? Unified plugin or individual plugins?">
    For users who use the presets we provide (such as `recommended` or `strict`), it is recommended to use the unified plugin `@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`. This simplifies configuration and ensures that all relevant rules are enabled correctly.

    For users who need more fine-grained control or build and maintain an ESLint configuration for themselves or their organization, it is recommended to use individual plugins. This allows you to freely select plugins and compose rules as needed, without being limited by presets

    <Callout type="warning">
      The unified plugin (`@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`) contains some historical decisions and internal behaviors that were originally made to be compatible with both Legacy Config and Flat Config. Reducing external package dependencies on it is better in the long run.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there anything to note about migrating from 'eslint-plugin-react'?">
    Please be aware that some rules may behave differently when transitioning to ESLint React. The rules in ESLint React are more closely aligned with the guidelines provided by [react.dev](https://react.dev). This alignment is due to ESLint React adopting [react.dev](https://react.dev) as its primary reference, rather than `eslint-plugin-react`.

    For a comprehensive migration guide with a complete rule comparison table, see our [Migration Guide](/docs/migration). This guide covers all rules from `eslint-plugin-react`, their ESLint React equivalents, missing functionality, and migration tips.

    To smoothly transition, we suggest reviewing the rules in ESLint React and running a comprehensive linting check on your codebase to identify and address any discrepancies introduced by the migration.
