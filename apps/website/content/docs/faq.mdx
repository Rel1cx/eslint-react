<Accordion title="Why create eslint-react?">

The existing `eslint-plugin-react` is a plugin for `react-dom` but named react[¹], it only supports React DOM[²] and does not being expected to be used with x-platform.

Although you can use it with other renderers, it will always assume that you are using the React DOM, even if you are working with a codebase that uses a different renderer. This can sometimes cause confusion and problems[³].

Unfortunately, the maintainers of `eslint-plugin-react` refuse to change that[⁴].

Just as in [Beyond the DOM](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html#beyond-the-dom) we believe the future of React Linter is not limited to the DOM. This influences every decision made in `eslint-react`, and it is the reason why we created it.

<Accordion title="Is there anything to note about migrating from eslint-plugin-react to eslint-react?">

Please be aware that some rules may behave differently when transitioning to `eslint-react`. The rules in `eslint-react` are more closely aligned with the guidelines provided by [react.dev](https://react.dev). This alignment is due to `eslint-react` adopting [react.dev](https://react.dev) as its primary reference, rather than `eslint-plugin-react`.

To smoothly transition, we suggest reviewing the rules in `eslint-react` and running a comprehensive linting check on your codebase to identify and address any discrepancies introduced by the migration.
