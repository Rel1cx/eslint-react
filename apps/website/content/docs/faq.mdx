<Accordion title="Why?">

**ESLint React addresses critical gaps of the existing `eslint-plugin-react` in modern React ecosystems**. While named "react", the current plugin implementation specifically targets React DOM and maintains DOM-centric assumptions, creating friction when used with alternative renderers like React Native, React Three Fiber, or custom renderers.

Our solution treating DOM as one of many supported targets rather than the default assumption. This paradigm shift enables:

- **Context-aware linting**: Adapting to different runtime environments
- **Future-proof architecture**: Compatibility with emerging React platforms
- **Unified code quality standards**: Consistent linting across diverse projects

<Accordion title="What's included?">

Currently, it includes the following:

  - `@eslint-react/kit`: ESLint React's plugin kit for building plugins and rules.
- **Core & Shared Modules**
  - `@eslint-react/core`: Utility module for static analysis of React core APIs and patterns.
  - `@eslint-react/shared`: Shared constants, types and functions.

<Accordion title="Why isn't there a 'jsx-runtime' preset?">

ESLint React automatically detects your JSX runtime type from the compiler options in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file, as well as from JSX pragma comments (e.g., `/** @jsxRuntime automatic */`) in each file. This means you don't need to set a preset for the JSX runtime.

For more information, see the [JSX Transform](/docs/configuration/configure-project-config#jsx-transform) section on the [Configure Project Config](/docs/configuration/configure-project-config) page.

<Accordion title="Is there anything to note about migrating from 'eslint-plugin-react'?">

Please be aware that some rules may behave differently when transitioning to ESLint React. The rules in ESLint React are more closely aligned with the guidelines provided by [react.dev](https://react.dev). This alignment is due to ESLint React adopting [react.dev](https://react.dev) as its primary reference, rather than `eslint-plugin-react`.

To smoothly transition, we suggest reviewing the rules in ESLint React and running a comprehensive linting check on your codebase to identify and address any discrepancies introduced by the migration.
