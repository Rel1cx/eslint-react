<Accordion title="Why?">

**ESLint React addresses critical gaps of the existing `eslint-plugin-react` in modern React ecosystems**. The current plugin assumes a DOM-centric model, which creates friction when working with alternative renderers like React Native, React Three Fiber, or custom renderers.

Key goals of ESLint React include:

- **Context-aware linting**: It adapts to different runtime environments, ensuring that linting rules are relevant to the specific platform youâ€™re targeting.
- **Future-proof architecture**: Designed to be compatible with emerging React platforms and technologies.
- **Unified code quality standards**: It enables consistent linting and code quality enforcement across various React-based projects, regardless of the rendering target.

This makes ESLint React a more flexible and modern alternative for working across diverse React ecosystems.

<Accordion title='Why is there no "jsx-runtime" preset?'>

ESLint React reads your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` configuration files to determines how to perform the JSX analysis internally. This means that you don't need to configure the JSX runtime in ESLint React, as it will automatically use the one configured in your project.

Additionally, this approach avoids potential problems where the JSX runtime configured in `eslint.config.js` might conflict with the one configured in `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`.

For more information, see the [JSX Runtime](/docs/configuration/configure-language-config#jsx-runtime) section on the [Configure Language Config](/docs/configuration/configure-language-config) page.

<Accordion title="Is there anything to note about migrating from eslint-plugin-react?">

Please be aware that some rules may behave differently when transitioning to ESLint React. The rules in ESLint React are more closely aligned with the guidelines provided by [react.dev](https://react.dev). This alignment is due to ESLint React adopting [react.dev](https://react.dev) as its primary reference, rather than `eslint-plugin-react`.

To smoothly transition, we suggest reviewing the rules in ESLint React and running a comprehensive linting check on your codebase to identify and address any discrepancies introduced by the migration.
